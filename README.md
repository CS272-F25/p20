# p20 (WIP)

## Description
The site includes a Home page that will briefly introduce the site and includes a form or a quiz, directly or linked to a post, where users can select their preferred genres, mood, and content type to generate a list of book recommendations. It will also feature a general Catalogue page with filters that allow users to sort or search books by genre, rating, year of publication, ISBN, etc. Additionally, we will have a Favorites page to display books the user has marked as liked/favorite/star on the Catalogue page using sessionStorage or localStorage. When users click on a book or a link associated with the book, like the title, it will bring them to a Book Details page providing greater detail about the book including but not limited to the book image, full title, author, rating, and summary. We will include a Community page for users to view posts about book trends and news, book reviews, rate this month's new releases, and view community recommendations. For general purposes, there will be an About Us page, and a Contact Us page. To provide a wide range of book options, we plan to fetch data from a publicly available book database as our external data source.
